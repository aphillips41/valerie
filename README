Welcome!

This directory is meant to be a python, docker, bash playground for beginners
Follow the steps below to get started.

To start over you can run the valerie_reset bash script and it will destroy and recreate your database container and pymongo image

Enjoy!



Install Docker
https://docs.docker.com/install/


create a mongo container
docker run -dit --name valerie_mongo --network aarxn_net -p 127.0.0.1:27017:27017 mongo:4.2.1


Use the Dockerfile to create a pymongo image 
We'll use this image to insert records into our database container
docker build -t valerie_pymongo .


Next you run python main.py multiple times to insert a record into your database container and cause your container to use resources 
(e.g. Memory and CPU)
for i in {0..69}; do python main.py; done


Open a new terminal to continue...


To see how your inserts are affecting the containers resource usage use the valerie stream to start capturing stats
The command below will start a process in the background
python valerie_stream.py &


To stop the stream you'll need to kill the background process 
https://ss64.com/bash/kill.html
ps | grep valerie_stream
kill $PID


To read the captured stats and print them use the valerie_stream_reader
You may not see output everytime you run this command
There are gaps in the stream where the stats are being overwritten with current values and there's nothing to read
python valerie_stream_reader.py



Stay tuned!
